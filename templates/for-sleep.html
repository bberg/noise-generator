        <h2>Why Noise Helps You Sleep</h2>
        <p>Your brain doesn't fully shut down during sleep—it continues monitoring for potential threats. Sudden sounds (a car door, a dog barking, a partner snoring) trigger alertness responses that fragment your sleep, even if you don't fully wake up.</p>
        <p><strong>Ambient noise creates a consistent sound blanket</strong> that masks these disruptions. Instead of silence punctuated by jarring sounds, your brain experiences steady, predictable audio that it learns to ignore.</p>

                <p>Consistent sound helps quiet racing thoughts and creates a calming bedtime ritual.</p>

                <h3>Better Sleep Quality</h3>
                <p>Research suggests pink noise may enhance slow-wave (deep) sleep.</p>

            <div class="noise-type">
                <h3><span class="noise-badge pink">Pink Noise</span> Most Recommended</h3>
                <p>Pink noise has a balanced, natural quality—like steady rainfall or wind through trees. Most people find it the most pleasant for sleep. Research from Northwestern University found that pink noise during sleep improved memory consolidation in older adults.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Most sleepers, especially those new to sleep sounds</p>
            </div>

            <div class="noise-type">
                <h3><span class="noise-badge brown">Brown Noise</span> Deep & Enveloping</h3>
                <p>Brown noise has more bass, creating a deep, rumbling sound like a waterfall or distant thunder. Many people find it the most relaxing and "cozy" noise color.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Those who prefer deeper sounds, light sleepers in noisy environments</p>

            <div class="noise-type">
                <h3><span class="noise-badge white">White Noise</span> Maximum Masking</h3>
                <p>White noise contains all frequencies equally, creating a consistent "hiss." It's the most effective at masking a wide range of sounds but some find it too bright for sleeping.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Very noisy environments, people who already use fans for sleep</p>

        <h2>Sleep Sound Tips</h2>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><strong>Start quiet:</strong> Use the lowest volume that masks disturbances. Louder isn't better.</li>
            <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Use the same sound nightly to build a sleep association.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Try each noise color for a few nights to find your preference.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a timer:</strong> Some prefer sound all night; others just need help falling asleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep it steady:</strong> Avoid sounds with variation (music, nature sounds with birds) that can grab attention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safe Listening for Sleep</h2>
        <p>For healthy sleep sound use:</p>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li>Keep volume at <strong>40-50 decibels</strong> (about the level of a quiet conversation)</li>
            <li>Place speakers across the room, not next to your head</li>
            <li>If using headphones, consider sleep-specific headband headphones at low volume</li>
            <li>For babies: follow AAP guidelines—below 50 dB, at least 7 feet from crib</li>
        </ul>
