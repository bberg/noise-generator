    <!-- Stochastic Resonance Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Stochastic Resonance</h2>

        <p>One of the most counterintuitive discoveries in neuroscience is that noise can actually improve signal detection. This phenomenon, called <strong>stochastic resonance</strong>, occurs when weak signals that would normally be undetectable become perceivable when an optimal level of noise is added to the system.</p>

        <h3>The Mechanism</h3>
        <p>Neurons have activation thresholds - a signal must be strong enough to trigger a response. When a signal falls below this threshold, adding random noise can occasionally push the combined signal-plus-noise above the threshold, making detection possible. <strong>Moss et al. (2004)</strong> demonstrated this across multiple sensory systems, showing that moderate noise levels enhance neural sensitivity.</p>

        <div class="key-findings">
            <h4><i class="ri-lightbulb-line"></i> Key Research Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimal noise level exists - too little has no effect, too much drowns out signals</li>
                <li>Effect demonstrated in auditory, visual, and tactile sensory systems</li>
                <li>May explain why some individuals focus better with background noise</li>
                <li>Neural systems naturally exhibit stochastic resonance under certain conditions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The practical implication is profound: ambient noise may literally help your brain detect and process information that would otherwise be lost. This provides a neurobiological basis for why many people report enhanced cognitive performance with background noise.</p>

        <h3>Applications to Focus</h3>
        <p>Stochastic resonance suggests that there's an optimal "noise floor" for cognitive work. Too quiet, and your brain may be understimulated; too loud, and signals get masked. Pink and brown noise, with their balanced frequency distributions, may provide ideal stochastic resonance conditions for sustained attention tasks.</p>

    <!-- ADHD & White Noise Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>ADHD & White Noise</h2>

        <h3>The Moderate Brain Arousal Model</h3>
        <p><strong>Soderlund et al. (2007)</strong>, published in <em>Behavioral and Brain Functions</em>, proposed a groundbreaking theory: individuals with ADHD may have lower baseline neural arousal, and external stimulation (like white noise) can help bring their arousal to optimal levels for cognitive performance.</p>

        <p>Their research showed that children with ADHD performed better on memory and cognitive tasks when exposed to white noise, while neurotypical children showed either no change or slight decrements. This suggests that noise affects different brains differently, depending on baseline arousal levels.</p>

        <table class="research-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Group</th>

        <h3>Dopamine and Arousal</h3>
        <p>The theory connects to dopamine system functioning. ADHD is associated with differences in dopaminergic signaling, which regulates arousal and attention. White noise may modulate dopamine release in ways that compensate for these differences, effectively "turning up the volume" on the brain's attention systems.</p>

    <!-- Sleep Architecture Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Sleep Architecture</h2>

        <h3>Effects on Slow-Wave Sleep</h3>
        <p><strong>Messineo et al. (2017)</strong> investigated how noise affects sleep architecture - the pattern of sleep stages throughout the night. Their research found that continuous noise, particularly pink noise, can enhance slow-wave sleep (deep sleep) and increase sleep spindle activity.</p>

        <p>Sleep spindles are bursts of neural oscillations during Stage 2 sleep that play a crucial role in memory consolidation and protecting sleep from disruption. Enhanced spindle activity is associated with better memory performance the following day.</p>

        <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-moon-line"></i> Slow-Wave Sleep</h4>
                <p>Pink noise can increase the amount and intensity of slow-wave activity, the deepest and most restorative phase of sleep. This phase is critical for physical recovery, immune function, and memory consolidation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-pulse-line"></i> Sleep Spindles</h4>
                <p>Continuous background noise increases sleep spindle density, which correlates with reduced sleep fragmentation and improved cognitive performance upon waking.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-shield-check-line"></i> Arousal Protection</h4>
                <p>Consistent noise creates an auditory "mask" that reduces the brain's response to sudden environmental sounds, decreasing awakenings and sleep stage transitions.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Timing and Synchronization</h3>
        <p>Some research suggests that pink noise, when timed to match the brain's natural slow oscillations, can actively boost slow-wave activity through acoustic stimulation. This "closed-loop" approach is an active area of sleep research with implications for memory enhancement and aging.</p>

    <!-- Auditory Masking Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Auditory Masking</h2>

        <h3>How Noise Masks Distracting Sounds</h3>
        <p><strong>Moore (2012)</strong>, in his comprehensive work on auditory processing, describes the psychoacoustic principles underlying sound masking. When continuous noise is present, the auditory system's ability to detect other sounds is reduced - a phenomenon called "energetic masking."</p>

        <p>For focus and sleep applications, this masking effect is beneficial: discrete, attention-grabbing sounds (conversations, traffic spikes, door slams) are perceptually reduced or eliminated, allowing sustained attention or uninterrupted sleep.</p>

        <h3>Critical Band Theory</h3>
        <p>Masking is most effective when the noise and the target sound fall within the same "critical band" - a range of frequencies that the ear processes together. Broadband noise (white, pink, or brown) is effective because it covers multiple critical bands simultaneously, masking a wide range of potential distractions.</p>

        <table class="research-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Noise Type</th>

                    <td>White Noise</td>
                    <td>Even across all frequencies</td>
                    <td>General sound masking, high-pitched sounds</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Pink Noise</td>
                    <td>Stronger at low frequencies</td>
                    <td>Balanced masking, speech, music</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Brown Noise</td>
                    <td>Strong bass, weak treble</td>
                    <td>Low-frequency sounds, traffic, HVAC</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Informational Masking</h3>
        <p>Beyond energetic masking, noise also provides "informational masking" - it reduces the brain's ability to extract meaningful content from competing sounds. This is why conversations become unintelligible against noise, even when technically audible. For focus, this prevents involuntary attention capture by semantic content.</p>

    <!-- Tinnitus Habituation Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Tinnitus Habituation</h2>

        <h3>The Jastreboff Neurophysiological Model</h3>
        <p><strong>Henry et al. (2006)</strong> and the foundational work by Jastreboff describe how the brain can learn to filter out persistent phantom sounds through a process called habituation. Sound therapy, including noise generators, is a core component of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT).</p>

        <p>The model proposes that tinnitus becomes distressing when the limbic (emotional) and autonomic nervous systems become conditioned to react to the phantom sound. Sound therapy works by:</p>

        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>Reducing contrast:</strong> Background noise decreases the perceived loudness of tinnitus relative to the environment</li>
            <li><strong>Promoting habituation:</strong> The brain learns to classify the mixed signal (tinnitus + noise) as unimportant</li>
            <li><strong>Breaking the reaction cycle:</strong> Reduced annoyance leads to reduced emotional response, which reduces attention to tinnitus</li>
            <li><strong>Neural plasticity:</strong> Over time, the auditory cortex may genuinely filter out the tinnitus signal</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-findings">
            <h4><i class="ri-volume-up-line"></i> Sound Therapy Guidelines</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use at "mixing point" - just loud enough to begin masking tinnitus, not fully covering it</li>
                <li>Consistency is key - use daily for extended periods (months)</li>
                <li>Pink noise is often preferred for its natural, balanced character</li>
                <li>Avoid complete masking - partial exposure promotes habituation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity and Recovery</h3>
        <p>Emerging research suggests that enriched acoustic environments may promote beneficial neural plasticity in the auditory system. For tinnitus sufferers, this means that consistent exposure to pleasant, low-level noise may actually change how the brain processes sound over time, potentially reducing tinnitus perception permanently.</p>

    <!-- Cognitive Load Theory Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Cognitive Load Theory</h2>

        <h3>Reducing Cognitive Interference</h3>
        <p><strong>Rausch et al. (2014)</strong> investigated how ambient noise affects cognitive load and found that moderate noise levels can actually reduce interference from irrelevant stimuli. The mechanism relates to the concept of "perceptual load" - when sensory processing is engaged with constant noise, fewer resources are available to process distracting stimuli.</p>

        <p>This creates a paradox: adding noise (which might seem like adding distraction) can actually reduce distractibility by occupying cognitive resources that would otherwise be captured by intermittent environmental sounds.</p>

        <div class="info-grid">
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-focus-3-line"></i> Attentional Focus</h4>
                <p>Consistent noise creates a stable auditory environment that reduces the orienting response to novel sounds. Your attention stays on-task rather than being repeatedly captured.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-brain-line"></i> Working Memory</h4>
                <p>Some studies suggest that noise can reduce the intrusion of task-irrelevant thoughts into working memory, improving sustained attention on complex cognitive tasks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-card">
                <h4><i class="ri-emotion-line"></i> Stress Reduction</h4>
                <p>Unpredictable noise is stressful; predictable noise is not. By converting an unpredictable acoustic environment into a consistent one, noise generators may reduce stress.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Optimal Complexity</h3>
        <p>Research by <strong>Mehta et al. (2012)</strong> found that moderate ambient noise (~70 dB) enhanced creative cognition compared to both silence and loud noise. The explanation involves processing disfluency - slight difficulty in processing promotes broader, more abstract thinking. This suggests that noise complexity and volume should be matched to task demands.</p>
