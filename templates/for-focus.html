        <h2>How Noise Improves Focus</h2>
        <p>Open offices, coffee shops, home distractions—modern life is full of interruptions. Each distraction doesn't just break your focus; it takes <strong>23 minutes on average</strong> to fully regain concentration.</p>
        <p>Ambient noise works in two ways:</p>

                <h3>Sound Masking</h3>
                <p>Consistent noise covers up distracting sounds—conversations, traffic, notifications—making them less attention-grabbing.</p>
            </div>

                <i class="ri-brain-line"></i>
                <h3>Cognitive Boost</h3>
                <p>Research suggests moderate noise (~70 dB) can enhance creative thinking by inducing a state of "processing disfluency."</p>

                <h3>Attention Anchor</h3>
                <p>Steady background sound gives your brain something consistent to tune out, reducing the pull of random stimuli.</p>

                <h3><span class="noise-badge pink">Pink Noise</span> General Focus</h3>
                <p>Pink noise is balanced and natural—not too harsh, not too rumbly. It's the best all-around choice for focus work.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Writing, reading, general office work, studying</p>
            </div>

                <h3><span class="noise-badge white">White Noise</span> Noisy Environments</h3>
                <p>White noise has the strongest masking power across all frequencies. Use it when you need maximum distraction blocking.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Open offices, coffee shops, noisy homes</p>
            </div>

            <div class="noise-type">
                <h3><span class="noise-badge brown">Brown Noise</span> Deep Work</h3>
                <p>Brown noise's deep, rumbling quality creates an enveloping soundscape that some find ideal for sustained concentration.</p>
                <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Programming, complex analysis, long focus sessions</p>

        <h2>Focus with ADHD</h2>
        <p>Research suggests that white and pink noise may be particularly helpful for people with ADHD. A 2024 meta-analysis found that ambient noise improved cognitive performance in ADHD individuals.</p>
        <p>The theory: ADHD brains may have lower baseline arousal, and external stimulation helps bring arousal to optimal levels. Interestingly, the same noise may slightly <em>decrease</em> focus in neurotypical individuals in quiet environments.</p>
        <p><strong>If you have ADHD:</strong> Experiment with different noise colors and volumes. Many find it transformative; others notice no benefit. Start with pink noise at moderate volume.</p>

        <h2>Productivity Tips</h2>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><strong>Find your volume:</strong> Start quiet and increase until distractions fade. Too loud is counterproductive.</li>
            <li><strong>Pair with Pomodoro:</strong> Use noise during focus sessions, silence during breaks.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a ritual:</strong> Same noise + same workspace = faster focus activation over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Match intensity to task:</strong> Louder for noisy environments, quieter for already-quiet spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid music:</strong> Lyrics and melodies engage language processing. Noise is cognitively neutral.</li>
