        <h2>Remote Work Focus</h2>

        <p>The shift to remote and hybrid work has made acoustic control a critical productivity factor. Home environments present unique challenges: shared spaces, inconsistent noise levels, and the psychological difficulty of "getting into work mode" without environmental cues.</p>

        <h3>Open Office Noise Masking</h3>
        <p>Even in traditional offices, ambient noise generators have become standard tools. Open floor plans, while promoting collaboration, create acoustic chaos that fragments attention. Studies show that office workers lose an average of 86 minutes per day to noise distractions.</p>

            <li><strong>Start with pink noise:</strong> Most people find it the best balance of effectiveness and pleasantness for long sessions</li>

            <li><strong>Use quality speakers or headphones:</strong> Cheap audio equipment can cause listening fatigue</li>
            <li><strong>Consider the Pomodoro technique:</strong> Noise during focus periods, silence during breaks</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment with noise colors:</strong> Some tasks benefit from different types - try brown noise for creative work</li>

    <!-- Infant Sleep Section -->
    <section class="research-section">
        <h2>Infant Sleep</h2>

        <h3>Why Babies Respond to Noise</h3>
        <p>The womb is a surprisingly loud environment - approximately 70-90 dB, similar to a vacuum cleaner. Newborns are accustomed to constant whooshing sounds from blood flow, digestion, and external noise filtered through amniotic fluid. White and pink noise can recreate this familiar acoustic environment, promoting calm and sleep.</p>

        <div class="key-findings">
            <h4><i class="ri-heart-pulse-line"></i> Safe Decibel Levels</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>American Academy of Pediatrics recommends keeping noise below 50 dB in infant sleep environments</li>
                <li>Many commercial sound machines can exceed 85 dB at maximum volume - always test before use</li>
                <li>Place the device at least 7 feet (2 meters) from the crib</li>
                <li>Use the lowest effective volume - just loud enough to mask disruptive sounds</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Placement Guidelines</h3>
        <table class="research-table">

        <h3>Weaning Strategies</h3>
        <p>While noise can be tremendously helpful for infant sleep, most experts recommend gradually reducing dependence as the child grows:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li><strong>6-12 months:</strong> Begin gradually lowering volume over several weeks</li>
            <li><strong>12-18 months:</strong> Try using noise only for naps or only for nighttime</li>
            <li><strong>18-24 months:</strong> Experiment with noise-free sleep; some children transition easily</li>
            <li><strong>If regression occurs:</strong> Return to noise temporarily during developmental leaps or illness</li>
            <li><strong>No rush:</strong> Some children (and adults) simply sleep better with noise, and that's okay</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Library Alternatives</h3>
        <p>Not everyone has access to a quiet library, and even libraries have noise issues: whispered conversations, keyboard clicks, HVAC systems, and the occasional cell phone. Ambient noise can create a "portable library" anywhere.</p>

            <li><strong>Consider your attention style:</strong> Those who are easily distracted may benefit more from noise</li>
            <li><strong>Time your sessions:</strong> Use a timer to create focused study blocks with noise, breaks without</li>
            <li><strong>Test before high-stakes study:</strong> Make sure noise helps rather than hinders your particular learning style</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with other techniques:</strong> Noise pairs well with the Pomodoro technique, spaced repetition, and active recall</li>

        <h3>Moderate Noise and Creativity</h3>
        <p>Research by <strong>Mehta et al. (2012)</strong> published in the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> found a surprising relationship between ambient noise and creative cognition. Moderate noise levels (~70 dB) enhanced creative performance compared to both low noise (~50 dB) and high noise (~85 dB).</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Too quiet: Easy processing leads to narrow, focused thinking (good for detail work)</li>
                <li>Too loud: Overwhelming noise impairs all cognitive processing</li>
                <li>~70 dB: Optimal for creative ideation, brainstorming, and problem-solving</li>

        <h3>Clinical Use in Hearing Tests</h3>
        <p>In audiology, narrowband and broadband noise play crucial roles in accurate hearing assessment. When testing one ear, noise is applied to the non-test ear to prevent "cross-hearing" - where sound presented to one ear is heard by the other ear through bone conduction.</p>
